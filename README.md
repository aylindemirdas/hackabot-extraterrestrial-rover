# About the Project

    This is our solution for the "Hack-a-Bot" 2024 Hackathon, the "Extraterrestrial Rover Challenge". Equipped with an Arduino Uno, ESP32 camera module, motors, wheels, and other components, we designed and constructed a teleoperated rover capable of completing various tasks representative of extraterrestrial missions. Our rover successfully navigated through obstacle courses, pushed ping-pong balls into designated pits, and captured pictures of the environment. Through resourcefulness and innovation, we tackled the challenge of creating a robust rover that can withstand harsh environments and operate effectively without direct visibility. Our project demonstrates the ingenuity required for developing solutions in extreme environments, showcasing both hardware and software expertise.

# Contribution

    Our team worked collaboratively to bring this project to life. All team members contributed to the overall success. The primary contributions in coding and software development were made by [Emine-Aylin Demirdas] and [Jean Paul Fernandez]. We were responsible for implementing the algorithms, designing the software interface, and ensuring the functionality of the rover's control systems.

    [Luna Valentina Fernandez] and [Joseph Pirrie] played crucial roles in the physical aspects of the project, including engineering and electrical components. Their expertise was most valuable in integrating the software with the hardware and ensuring the rover's robustness in various terrains, ensuring the rover would pass the numerous obstacles it was required to.
